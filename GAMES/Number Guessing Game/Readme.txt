GUESSING GAME
1. If a player's guess is less than 1 or greater than 100, say 'OUT OF BOUNDS
2. On a player's first turn, if their guess is within     
       -10 of the number, return 'WARM!'    
       -further than 10 away from the number, return 'COLD!'")
3. On all subsequent turns, if a guess is    
       -closer to the number than the previous guess return 'WARMER!'
       -farther from the number than the previous guess, return 'COLDER!'")
4. When the player's guess equals the number, tell them they've guessed correctly and how many guesses it took!
